### üöß IN PROGRESS

**Backend**

- [ ] ML model implementation (prediction service has placeholder)
- [ ] News sentiment analysis service
- [ ] WebSocket implementation for real-time data
- [ ] Portfolio optimization algorithms

**Mobile App**

- [ ] Chart components implementation
- [ ] Real-time price updates
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search

### üîÑ NEXT PRIORITIES

1. **Complete ML Models** (Week 1-2)

   - Implement LSTM model for price predictions
   - Add technical indicators calculation
   - Sentiment analysis for news

2. **Real-time Features** (Week 2-3)

   - WebSocket integration
   - Live price updates
   - Push notifications

3. **Enhanced UI/UX** (Week 3-4)
   - Interactive charts
   - Advanced portfolio analytics
   - Performance optimizations

## Current Issues

### Critical

- API keys needed for external data sources
- ML models need training data and implementation
- Real-time WebSocket not implemented

### Minor

- Chart rendering performance on Android
- WebSocket connection drops on app background
- Some UI polish needed

## API Keys Status

- Alpha Vantage: ‚úÖ [RT1Y2YVLOG3BY9RI]
- News API: ‚ùå [9058ec2735644c83bba49d48daa8291a]
- Polygon.io: ‚ùå [qPJo0ZkXSpVM74OdYYb9rtQMdoYBKK7e]

## Technical Debt

- Unit tests needed for services
- Error handling could be more robust
- API rate limiting not implemented
- Docker containers for deployment
