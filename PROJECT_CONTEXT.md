## Technical Architecture

### Current Stack

**Frontend (React Native + Expo)**

- TypeScript for type safety
- Redux Toolkit + RTK Query for state management
- React Navigation for navigation
- Expo for development and deployment
- WebSocket for real-time updates

**Backend (FastAPI + Python)**

- FastAPI for REST API and WebSocket endpoints
- SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL (primary)
- Redis for caching and sessions
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- yfinance for stock data integration

**Services Architecture**

- Modular service layer (WebSocket, Config, Notifications)
- React hooks for service integration
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Environment-aware configuration management

### Real-time Data Flow

```
Mobile App → WebSocket Service → FastAPI WebSocket → Stock Data APIs
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓
Redux Store ← Price Updates ← Connection Manager ← Live Prices
```

```

### Critical

- API keys needed for external data sources
- ML models need training data and implementation
- Real-time WebSocket not implemented

### Minor

- Chart rendering performance on Android
- WebSocket connection drops on app background
- Some UI polish needed

## API Keys Status

- Alpha Vantage: ✅ [RT1Y2YVLOG3BY9RI]
- News API: ❌ [9058ec2735644c83bba49d48daa8291a]
- Polygon.io: ❌ [qPJo0ZkXSpVM74OdYYb9rtQMdoYBKK7e]

## Technical Debt

- Unit tests needed for services
- Error handling could be more robust
- API rate limiting not implemented
- Docker containers for deployment
